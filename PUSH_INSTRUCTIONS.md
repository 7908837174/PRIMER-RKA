# GitHub Push Instructions

This document provides instructions for pushing this project to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/7908837174/PRIMER-RKA.git

## Option 1: Using Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. **Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub**:
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Generate new token
   - Give it a name and select the "repo" scope
   - Copy the generated token

2. **Push using the token**:
   ```bash
   # Run this command in your terminal, replacing YOUR_TOKEN with your actual token
   git push -f https://7908837174:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/7908837174/PRIMER-RKA.git main
   ```

   Or use the provided script:
   ```
   .\simple_push.bat
   ```
   and enter your token when prompted.

## Option 2: Using GitHub CLI

1. **Install GitHub CLI** if not already installed:
   - Download from: https://cli.github.com/

2. **Login to GitHub**:
   ```
   gh auth login
   ```
   Follow the prompts to authenticate.

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```
   gh repo create 7908837174/PRIMER-RKA --public --source=. --push
   ```
   Or if the repository already exists:
   ```
   git push -f origin main
   ```

## Option 3: Clone the Repository First

Sometimes it's easier to clone the repository first and then copy your files:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/7908837174/PRIMER-RKA.git
   ```

2. **Copy your files** into the cloned directory (excluding the .git folder)

3. **Commit and push**:
   ```
   cd PRIMER-RKA
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- If you see a 403 error, it means you don't have permission to push to the repository. Make sure you're using a valid token with the correct permissions.
- If you're the owner of the repository, make sure you're using the correct username and token.
- If you're not the owner, you need to be added as a collaborator to the repository.
